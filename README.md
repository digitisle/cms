# Welcome to the CMS Interview Task

This task is a super easy, coding challenge, split into a number of steps to make it easy to follow along with. It is not supposed to be an in-depth test of your technical knowlegde, but will hopefully give us an idea of how you think and work.

## The Task

The task is simple, make a call to an API (provided for you at http://localhost:3001/api/home), which will return a JSON object from our Headless CMS system, and render that data in the React App.

### Step 1.

Add "state" to the App component, and fetch the data from http://localhost:3001/api/home, parse it and place into component state.

### Step 2.

Add the code to render the page state using the App component. The markup used should be as semantic as possible.

### Step 3.

Add the styles to the App.css file, to render the page, as per the attached "expected-result.jpg".

### Step 4.

Optimise the site for SEO.

### Step 5.

Refactor/Optimise.
